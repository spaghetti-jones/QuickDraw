# QuickDraw

______________

Execute:

javac *.java

java QuickDraw

______________

The program contains the uses my Mosaic programming code as base.

So far, an erase and fill button have been implemented.

you can click to create a line.

I am thinking about going a different direction with the project and thus may scrap this code and start over.

I was unable to create code that allows the user to click and drag to create a line.

I also found it difficult to create small square blocks instead of horizontal lines.

______________

I intend to implement different colors and a functioning click and drag mouse listener in version 2.
