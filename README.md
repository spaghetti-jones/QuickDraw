# QuickDraw

______________

Execute:

javac *.java

java QuickDraw

______________

In QuickDraw, the user can draw inside of the program.

There are multiple JRadiobuttons and JButtons implemented into the program.

These allow you to switch the size of the brush, color of the brush or switch to eraser.

The "New Page" and "Erase All" buttons essentially server the same purpose.

I would have hoped to have been able to implement a way to save the image that the user draws.

There also is a graphical glitch occuring on the frame that I do not know how to fix.
